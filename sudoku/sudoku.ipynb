    "# GRADED ASSIGNMENT: Implementing sudoku puzzle solver\n",
    "\n",
    "**The notebook is part of a graded coursework assignment for your unit. Full instructions and specifications of the coursework as a whole are in the accompanying pdf.** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid with some fixed values. To solve the puzzle, you need to fill the empty cells of the grid such that the numbers 1 to 9 appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 block of the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample puzzle along with its solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sudoku.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you write your implementation of an agent to solve sudoku puzzles for submission as part of your coursework i.e., solver implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a reminder of the key rules associated with the implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    " * You can use any algorithm you like, from the course material or otherwise, provided you can implement it yourself from scratch.\n",
    "   \n",
    " * The assessment criteria of your solver implementation will be **correctness** and **speed** of sudoku puzzle solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    " * The implementation will be assessed using **automated testing**. It is crucial for you to ensure that your implementation is compatible with the automarker by following the input/output specifications of the code template given in the notebook. The compatibility of your solution to the automarker must be tested using pre-submission tests (detailed in this notebook under **Phase Two: Essential Pre-submission Tests**). Failure to ensure compatibility to the automarker using the procedure in this notebook will result in a zero for the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    " * You can test correctness of your implementation using the set of puzzles of various difficulty provided with this assignment. Automated testing will also include additional (hidden) puzzles which you are not given access to.\n"

    "## Preliminaries: loading the puzzle data\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, the cell below will load in some sample sudoku puzzles for you to see the format. There are sudokus of various difficulty levels provided: easier sudokus typically have more pre-filled cells. The cell below illustrates how to load the puzzles using the easiest difficulty level as an example. However, you can load a puzzle of any difficulty from the provided set by changing the input file. The test cell in **Phase Two: Essential Pre-submission Tests** automates the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sudoku is a 9x9 NumPy array of integers, where zero represents an empty square. Each difficulty level in the provided set comes with 15 sudokus, so when you load the file, it is stored in a 15x9x9 array."
